# Liverpool-Chronicles-EPL-25-26
A living archive of Liverpool goals and match results.

As a Liverpool ⚽ supporter and fan, I used my love for futbol to fuel my journey into programming.  
This archive is more than code—it's a digital shrine to the 2025/26 season, built to grow with every match.

📦 Features
- 🗂️ Player goal tracking with timestamps and opponents
- 📅 Match result logging (Win, Loss, Draw)
- 🛠️ Clearly marked update zones for easy expansion
- 📊 Clean console output for goals and match summaries

🧪 Coming Soon

- 📈 Average goals per game calculator
- ⚖️ Win vs Loss ratio tracker
- 🧮 Match-by-match goal distribution
- 🧠 VAR corrections and disallowed goal handling
- 🏟️ Match metadata: date, stadium, tags like #Rivalry or #Redemption

I would love to see others use this to make something similar with their favorite sports teams.
